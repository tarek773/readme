# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System – MovieLens Dataset

![Recommendation System Architecture](images/recommendation_system.png)

## 🔍 Overview
In today's streaming era, users face decision fatigue when choosing what to watch. This project addresses that challenge by building an **intelligent movie recommendation system** based on the [MovieLens 20M Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/). The system applies **collaborative filtering**, **content-based filtering**, and **hybrid models** to provide relevant and personalized movie recommendations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Extract insights from user rating behaviors.
- Analyze and utilize movie metadata (genres, titles).
- Implement various recommendation strategies: collaborative, content-based, hybrid.
- Build a backend-ready architecture for integration in real applications.
- Ensure modular, testable, and extensible system design.
